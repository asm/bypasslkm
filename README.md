# Bypass LKM
Use this app to bypass loadable kernel module authenication on Samsung phones.  This is handy when you're developing your own modules or you've mixed and matched OS and firmware versions.

A few offsets are included but if your phone is not listed, you'll need to follow the instructions here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2578566 to find your offset (requires a disassembler).

Use Android Studio (with the NDK installed) to build this app.  Good luck!
